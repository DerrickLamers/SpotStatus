# SpotStatus
Spotify Now Playing Menu Bar Utility for MacOS Mojave

## Intro
There are a lot of good Spotify + menu bar projects that already exist, but many are outdated and few have been updated for OSX Mojave (and its [awesome gatekeeper "features‚Äù](https://joshspicer.com/applescript-mojave)).  SpotStatus was build from the ground up specifically for Mojave. 

Easily see at a glance what song is playing. Click in to see more details (including artist information).

I find myself sharing a lot of music via spotify uris.  In the menu bar you can add that uri to your clipboard for easy sending.

Written in Swift 4.  Utilizes AppleScript to speak with Spotify, thus permission to do so is necessary on first launch.  App _Should_ support from 10.12+. Permission granting is only necessary on 10.14+ (Mojave).  

## Preferences

SpotStatus can be configured via its preferences panel.
